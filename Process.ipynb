      "As long as capital markets have existed, investors and aspiring arbitrageurs alike have strived to gain edges in predicting stock prices. In particular, use of machine-learning techniques and quantitative analysis to make stock price predictions has become increasingly popular with time. Success, however, can be hard to come by; predicting financial price movements is an extremely difficult task. Nevertheless, the motivation for doing so is constantly present, with lucrative opportunities and insightful outcomes awaiting victors in an ongoing information battle.\n",

      "Our team wishes to use the Data Science framework we learned in CS 109 to take our chances at predicting stock price movements. Through the Boston Data Festival, we participated in a competition organized by Hack/Reduce and sponsored by DataRobot on November 10. The task of the competition was to take data from the past 9 days of a stock's pricing data and the opening price on the 10th day to predict whether the closing price on the 10th day is greater than or less than the opening price on the 10th day. After experimenting with various singular and stacked models, we eventually were able to devise a model that obtained an AUC of 0.941, which won us 1st place in the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through this engaging and rewarding experience with predictive stock price modeling, we became very excited about the real-world applications of this kind of model and wanted to go more in depth into our predictive analysis after the competition. Our CS109 final project gave us a structured opportunity to extend our work. We aim to test a variety of models on S&P 500 stocks encompassing a different industries and quantify the success of our models. Such analysis may give Buffalo Capital Management an upper hand in any future investing endeavors!\n",

      "We were inspired by the successes we've seen in algorithmic trading and computer-assisted stock analysis. Several well-documented effects we've read about online are the momentum effect and regression to the mean. There has been a lot of research conducted about the significance of the momentum effect in stock price prediction. For example, Lee and Swaminathan (2002) studied the relationship between momentum and value trading strategies, while Grinblatt and Moskowitz (2004) examined the effect of consistent positive past returns on the link between past and expected returns. The wealth of research into price momentum made us interested in examining this effect further and seeing how it could be applied to stock price prediction models. "

As such, we will only utilize the opening and closing prices.\n",

Hence, it may not make sense that we are using 9 days of opening and closing prices to make predictions if only the last 3 days, for instance, are most pertinent to making a prediction. However, when running our model, we see that including information from all the days of stock prices that we are given does tend to improve the model.

      "Testing out our four different individual models (LASSO, Ridge, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees), we had the hypothesis that combining the models into some sort of ensemble would let us have better predictive performance in terms of AUC. We came to this conclusion because of our understanding of ensemble methods from CS 181 and CS 109. Ensemble methods (like random forests from week 10), help average out the bias and reduce the variance of our models to achieve better predictive performance.\n",

In this paper, he created binary probability estimates via logistic regression on the inputs from classification models (Platt uses SVM). We will do the same, and place the probability estimates of each of our 4 models into a logistic regression model, to form a blended model that takes in contributions from all of the input models.\n",

We have an intuition for that due to our exposure in CS 109. Below is the code that we use to generate those out-of-sample estimates."

      "We were curious ourselves about how the LASSO model managed to get a negative weight. We did research by asking on Quora (http://qr.ae/GO95p) and recieved a helpful answer from another student who helped explain it to us. We learned that this was because **the bias of the LASSO model was positively correlated with the biases from at least one of the other models**. Thus a blended model that assigned *negative* weight to LASSO and positive weight to another model whose biases were postively correlated with those of LASSO helped us correct the biases and lead to a better model.\n",

The differences between abilities to predict sectors is minute, and random forest performed the worst out of all of the individual models. Ridge regression performed better than the other individual models probably because the features were fairly linear with respect to the logit probability.

Note that this does not directly correspond to accuracy, and we do not test the direct accuracy of our predictions. The simple layman interpretation of AUC, however, is that if we were given a random data point where the closing price is higher than the opening price and another where the opposite is true, we would be able to correclty differentiate the two with over 90% accuracy. This may come at a surprise to many familiar with the stock market. The usual response to hearing this result is to inquire as to the viability of a trading strategy focused on these patterns.

      "We mention above that the blended models help average out those biases and make more well-calibrated models. Intuitively, this does make sense because we are essentially applying existing philosophies regarding how committee classifiers can often be used to reduce variance while maintaining relatively low bias, which can improve predictive accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this confirms some of the work that we have done. Although, it may make sense intuitively that blending different models may make sense, there is no existing mainstream Python functions that perform this task, although we have provided one over the course of our project. This may, in fact, be the single greatest contribution of our project.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also notice that another reason why blending may help is because it can help compensate for models that tend to be inaccurate for different parts of the data. For instance, when we blend Lasso with Ridge Regression, or blend Random Forest with Gradient Boosted Trees, we see that the AUC actually decreases. Based on our understanding of the behavior of these models, it is likely because these respective pairs of models are positively correlated with each other. (In fact, when we blend Lasso with Ridge Regression using Platt Scaling, Lasso actually receives a negative weight!) Blending, as we now understand, makes most sense between models that exhibit negative correlation. Juxtaposing Ridge Regression and Random Forest makes sense for precisely this reason; their negative correlation allows the blend to, in part, compensate for some of their individual insufficiencies in the pursuit of the best possible model."

      "We generally see that there is not much of a difference in AUC between the different industries that we looked at, although Healthcare yields the highest AUCs. We see that there is a minor dropoff in the AUC values between our historical data set from the early 1990's and our modern data from 2012-13. This may be an indication that it is harder to make accurate predictions on modern data compared to historical data, perhaps because of fewer market inefficiencies over time.\n"
